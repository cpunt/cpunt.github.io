I am a 23 year old programmer from the UK. I have been studying programming for the last 3 years. I mainly use JavaScript, PHP and Python for my programming needs.

I also enjoy learning about data structures and algorithms, this is what my articles are largely going to be focused on. Thanks for checking out my articles.
