title: About Me
---

I am a 24 year old programmer from the UK. I have been programming for the last 4 years. In this time I have mainly used JavaScript, PHP and Python for my programming needs.

I always like expanding my programming knowledge and improving my skills. A large area of interest to me are data structures and algorithms. This is the area my articles will mainly be focused on. Thanks for checking out my articles.
