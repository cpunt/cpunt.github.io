title: About Me
---

I am a 23 year old programmer from the UK. I have been studying programming for the last 3 years. I mainly use JavaScript, PHP and Python for my programming needs.

I also enjoy learning about data structures and algorithms, this is what my articles are largely going to be focused on. Thanks for checking out my articles and I'll leave you with one of my favourite quotes by Sir Issac Newton.
